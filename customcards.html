                    <p>The M416, the last of the military 1/4 ton Jeep trailers, can be distinguished from earlier 1/4
                        ton trailers by its squared fenders. There were two later versions, the M416A1 and the M416B1.
                        The M416B1 used the smaller 6.00 X 16 tires on M422 wheels because it was designed to be towed
                        by the USMC M422 'Mighty Mite' instead of the M151 that towed the M416's and M416</p>

                    <h3>ASSAULT RIFLE &COPY;M16</h3>
                    <p>The M16 rifle (officially designated Rifle, Caliber 5.56 mm, M16) is a family of assault rifles
                        adapted from the ArmaLite AR-15 rifle for the United States military. The original M16 rifle was
                        a 5.56Ã—45mm automatic rifle with a 20-round magazine</p>

                    <h3>ASSAULT RIFLE &COPY;MK13</h3>
                    <p>The MK 13 rifle is made using the Accuracy International Chassis System (AICS) version 2.0 mated
                        to a long action Remington 700 receiver. The AICS 2.0 folding stock reduces the rifle's overall
                        length by 210 mm (8.3 in) when folded and adds 0.2 kg (0.44 lb) to the rifle's total weight</p>
