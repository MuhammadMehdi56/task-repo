     <h1>4. CLEANING EYES</h1>
     <p>If Your Dog Is Holding One Eye Partially Or Complete Shut, Or Is Pawing At His Eyes, He Is Experiencing Pain And Irritation.
          Its Common For Light-Colored Dogs To Develop Brown Tearstains In The Lower Corners Of Their Eyes. Tearstains Are Most Often Caused By The Anatomy Of Their Eyes,
           Which Makes It Difficult For Tears To Drain Normally.
          Breeds Like Chihuahuas And Pekingese With Rounded Eyes Are Particularly Prone To This Problem, As Well As Breeds With A Lot Of Hair Surrounding The Eyes.</p>

          The Time And Ability To Give Them The Exercise They Need To Keep Them Happy.

     <h1>6. CLEANING EARS OF DOGS</h1>
     <p>You Should Clean Your Dogs Ears Once A Month, More If They Are Prone To Ear Problems. Clean The Outer Part Of The Ear Only,
          Using A Damp Cloth Or A Cotton Swab Soaked In Mineral Oil. Never Force Anything Into The Ear. Some Dogs Need The Hair Plucked Just Inside The Ear To Keep Air Circulating.
           Again, Gently Message The Base Of The Ear To Help Work Debris And Leaning Solution Toward The Cotton And Dry The Canal.
            Again, Gently Message The Base Of The Ear To Help Work Debris And Cleaning Solution Toward

     <h1>7. CLEANING PAWS OF DOGS</h1>
     <p>While Theres No Hard-And-Fast Rule For How Often You Should Clean Your Dogs Paws, Its Wise To Incorporate Regular Paw Checks Into Your Grooming Schedule.
          This Will Give You A Chance To Spot Any Wounds Or Pain Points Before They Become Serious. At A Minimum, You Should Clean Your Dogs Paws During Bath Time,
          But Make A Habit Out Of Doing Quick Checks Every Week. If Your Dog Has Long Fur, They Might Need Paw Checks After Each Walk.</p>
